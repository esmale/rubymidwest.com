              <h4>Problem:</h4>
              <p class='abstract'>As a system administrator, you spend too much time working on your  laundry list of tasks to keep everything a float.  You need to find  ways to "glue" together the holes in your sinking ship.</p>
              <h4>Solution:</h4>
              <p class='abstract'>First, identify the problem areas.  Next, see what is out there to  help you get your task done.  Accept that not every solution out there does exactly what you want.  Finally, start rolling your  own solutions, in Ruby, where they make sense.</p>
              <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
              <p class='abstract'>Understand that, while Ruby is not the silver bullet for all your  system administration needs, it does suffice in many areas and  speeds up development of the seemingly endless pile of scripts  needed to stay on top of things.  The key is to not be afraid to  reinvent a wheel here or there to get a better ride.</p>

                How can Ruby change cities, states, and countries for the better? Last year, we saw an explosion of interest around government transparency. The Open Government movement, spearheaded by open source developers, seeks to make government more accountable and responsible by turning open government data into citizen-focused, civic-minded applications.
              </p>
              <p class='abstract'>Luigi Montanez, a Ruby developer with the Sunlight Labs, will guide you through the Gov 2.0 landscape. You'll learn about the data sets and APIs available freely available for your use, the tools and skills you'll need to be a successful civic hacker, and you'll get a thorough overview of the current civic apps out there. Civic hacking will enhance your open source portfolio while making a difference in your community and country.</p>

                The complex nature of application deployment can make configuration management challenging. As you scale your applications by adding more servers the complexity continues to grow, making a headache for even the most experienced systems administrators.
              </p>
              <p class='abstract'>Chef is a Ruby based open source systems integration framework for managing servers. Using Chef within your infrastructure is economical, scalable and efficient, allowing you to do more with less. Chef lets you manage your servers by writing code, not running commands.</p>
              <p class='abstract'>In this session we will cover:</p>

                An efficient &amp; effective development ecosystem requires thorough testing. The purpose of integration testing is to verify functional, performance, and reliability requirements placed on major design items. Functional and unit tests are an excellent start, however, bugs emerge when not testing the application as a whole.
                <p class='abstract'>Ryan Felton will begin with a walk through of local integration testing strategies using Capybara gem, which utilizes Selenium Webdriver, to open you web browser, navigate the specified web page, and verify functionality via simple webrat syntax. The second part of this talk will be lead by Kyle Ginavan discussing the short comings of this approach and how to preform multi-browser cross platform integration testing via the <a href="http://www.seleniumshots.com">Selenium Shots</a> integration testing service</p>

                Maybe you've played with jQuery a little bit but still don't feel comfortable with it, or maybe you've only heard about it. Either way, it doesn't take long to learn enough to be dangerous. While jQuery can be intimidating at first, it's based on some very simple principles. Once you grasp those principles, your JavaScript life will never be the same.
              </p>
              <p class='abstract'>This talk will focus mostly on jQuery itself, but I'll also hit the basics on how to make the most of jQuery in your Rails apps.  I'll cover the relevant changes in Rails 3, and why you don't need Rails 3 to take advantage of those changes.  By the end of this talk, you'll be easily navigating and manipulating the DOM, writing your own plugins, and of course, amazing your friends with the power and elegance of jQuery.</p>

                If you've ever seen "class &lt;&lt; self" in somebody's code and wondered what the heck is going on behind the scenes, you're not alone.  What you've stumbled upon is the ever-elusive metaclass (or eigenclass, or singelton class... take your pick).  The metaclass is often a point of confusion at first, but this is mostly just because Ruby tries its darndest to hide it from you.  In this session, I will show you what's really going on with metaclasses, and how they make Ruby great.  By the end of the session, you will understand how simple and elegant using metaclasses can be.

                To quote Eric Meyer, "Semantic Frameworks are a game-changer." Meta CSS frameworks like SASS, lessCSS, and xCSS are revolutionizing the way we write and manage modern, semantic CSS. With features such as variables, mixins, nested rules and operations, these meta frameworks brings us closer to write our CSS in an object oriented way.  They incorporate CSS frameworks such as Blueprint, Grid960, and YUI and bring together the best of grid design, CSS reset techniques and browser hacks in an unobtrusive and semantic way.  Ultimately, these meta frameworks allow us to develop truly semantic websites that are not only maintainable and fun to develop.  This talk with discuss CSS systems, meta frameworks, and best practices for writing object oriented, unobtrusive semantic code.

                While there is a lot of excitement surrounding MongoDB and the NoSQL movement, MongoDB is all about practicality. MongoDB boasts a robust feature set that provides a pragmatic blend of rich functionality, performance and scalability that today's software developers need, and all at a relatively low barrier to entry.
              </p>
              <p class='abstract'>The first part of this talk will focus on the pragmatic justifications for integrating MongoDB into your stack. In short, Mongo's significant performance and scalability benefits matched with a robust feature set provide the flexibility and power needed to smoothly integrate into an existing stack.</p>
              <p class='abstract'>Building off of the first part of this talk, the main part of this talk will highlight some common and practical uses for MongoDB, given it's rich feature set, high level of performance and it's philosophy.</p>
              <p class='abstract'>Among the projects we'll cover are logging with capped collections, data warehousing for reporting or analytics, and building lightweight, single-purpose ruby applications around a MongoDB collection. We'll also cover more full-featured applications, including a simple accounting application, and the traditional blogging app.</p>
              <p class='abstract'>The goal in discussing each one of these applications is to highlight a different part Mongo's feature set to show how pragmatic it can be to integrate MongoDB into your stack. By the end of this talk, you will have a solid grasp on Mongo's rich feature set, and why it makes sense in so many situations.</p>

                Explaining Redis is tough, it’s easy to say “a data structures server” or “memcached on steroids” or something more jargon filled. The biggest selling point of Redis is that usually as programmers we have to bend our data into a table or document to save it, but with Redis we can persist data as we conceptually visualize it. We'll go over the basics of Redis, how to use it with your Ruby applications, and some real use cases.

                Many presentations focus on showing off new applications and libraries. They show you what has been accomplished, but rarely do they show you how. This presentation will take examples from production code (mainly from Sequel), showing techniques that you can use in your own code. Some of the techniques demonstrated will relate to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Creating more easily extensible code</li>
                <li>Handling class-level data within inheritance hierarchies</li>
                <li>Improving dynamically defined method performance safely</li>
                <li>Structuring DSL implementations</li>
                <li>Presenting multiple backends as one</li>
              </ul>

                Tools like Facebooker make Facebook development seductively simple, and they will get you 80% done. Unfortunately, the last 20% can be a brutal death gauntlet, where common mistakes, and API ambiguities among others factors leave budgets shattered, developers exhausted and clients frustrated. I will show you how to survive the last 20% using techniques and code refined over the last two years. This presentation will be segmented into these subtopics:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Speeding up Facebook development through Rails templates</li>
                <li>Iframe vs. FBML, choosing the right application type</li>
                <li>Minimizing API calls, though caching and hydrators</li>
                <li>Cheap and easy speed boosts to your Facebook application</li>
                <li>Avoiding common development gotchas in Facebook development.</li>

                There are a wave of new open standards taking aim at the holy grail of interoperability: comments cross-posted from one site to another, follow me on Twitter and you follow me on Facebook, too. Are these standards taking hold or are they just an idle pipe dream? Learn about PubSubHubBub, OStatus, Salmon, ActivityStreams and more in a quest to decipher the interoperable web.
              </p>
              <p class='abstract'>Attendees will learn about different emerging open standards for web interoperability, where they're being used today, and where they could be used in the future. Once a basic understanding of the standards is presented, attendees will get some first-hand examples of the current state of the Ruby ecosystem for these standards and how they can support them in their own applications.</p>
              <h3 class='speaker-title'>The Necessity and Implementation of Speedy Tests</h3>
              <p class='abstract'>
                <span class='speaker-name'>Jake Scruggs &ndash;</span>
                Your project's software practices are deteriorating every minute the developers wait for slow tests to finish. Once developers get fed up and stop running the tests, disregard for failing builds can't be far behind, and from there it's only a short leap to the albatross of a brittle/irrelevant test suite. Luckily this can all be avoided by adopting some time-saving testing standards and practices.
              </p>
              <p class='abstract'>If everyone knows that test suites should be fast then why do they take so damn long? Some of that is lack of knowledge about what’s fast and what is not, but mostly the problem is lack of awareness of 2 things:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>When you write tests you should be thinking about their speed.</li>
                <li>A test that needs lots of setup is telling you something: Your object sucks.</li>
              </ol>
              <p class='abstract'>Test suites usually grow and stumble along without too much thought. “Hey thing X looks shiny, let’s add that in.” is about as far as the process often goes. You need to architect your test suite just like any other part of your code. This does NOT mean lots of meetings and UML diagrams, but adopting a set of team testing guidelines and practices. And, of course, communicating those guidelines and practices to new developers.</p>
              <p class='abstract'>Some topics I’ll be discussing:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Big Setup == Big Problem</li>
                <li>before :each {waste_my_time}</li>
                <li>FactoryGirl is too damn awesome</li>
                <li>The extra tricky test suite</li>
                <li>Just because mocking can solve some of your problems…</li>
                <li>Use all your cores, damnit</li>
              </ul>
              <p class='abstract'>I’ve been on 10 projects with automated tests in the last 6 years and I’ve seen speedy confidence inducing suites and others that only served to make developers feel dread and guilt about testing. The point of this talk is to communicate tangible strategies for speedily testing Ruby.</p>

                I've written "a lot of code":<a href="http://github.com/geemus">http://github.com/geemus</a>, both hobby and work, over the last year, and looking back I can't help but think that writing code for yourself is easy; it's writing code for others can be tough. In this session, I'll share some examples of good and bad practices gathered in my years writing code and libraries, and discuss how to get past being too close to the problem. I'll talk specifically about growing your work into something anybody (and hopefully everybody) will use.
              </p>
              <p class='abstract'>Along the way we'll discuss the differences between code for yourself, code for other users and code for collaborators.</p>
              <p class='abstract'>Some example tips:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Help new users get started, but don't get in the way of power users.</li>
                <li>Examine the seams of your library and consider how you can keep it focused.</li>
                <li>Be consistent: more consistent code is easier for others to understand (and contribute to).</li>
              </ul>
              <p class='abstract'>I'll also go over some examples of things to avoid:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Don't monkey patching: don't muck with other peoples code, lest it muck back.</li>
                <li>Not invented here: once you start writing libraries it can be hard to stop.</li>
                <li>Exceptions: if everything in your library works like x, except y, then you always have an extra case to keep in mind.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class='abstract'>I'll share a mix of concepts and concrete examples that altogether will help nail down what it takes to write better library code.</p>

                One determined man's journey from fast food restaurant cashier to agile development leader in <span class="strike">three easy steps</span> 5 difficult years. My employer, part of one of the largest privately held media conglomerates in the world, now does development exclusively in Ruby/Rails, using agile methods.  When I started here, waterfall-esque .NET development with no formal process, version control strategy, continuous integration... was the norm. We were losing, big time.  Now, we have all of those things, and are delivering business value faster than ever.
              </p>
              <p class='abstract'>I am the technical leader of our development team.  Ruby, Rails, git, and Agile are some of my contributions to the way we do work now.   Five years ago I worked full-time as a cashier at a fast food restaurant, making minimum wage.  My journey did not include graduation from college, a fairy godmother, or some amazing life-changing revelation.</p>
              <p class='abstract'>My hope is a simple one.  To share hard-earned insights that can help other Rubyists or would-be Rubyists, to recognize and capitalize on potential and opportunity wherever they see it.  Through this insight, I believe they can find greater success, and more joy, in anything they do.</p>
