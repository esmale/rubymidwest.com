                      <strong>James</strong> has been in the Ruby community since before Rails shipped.  He's seen a ton of progress and survived many fads.  Along the way, mostly by accident, he learned a lot about being a programmer.  He now enjoys sharing that knowledge with other programmers by writing code, adding documentation, participating in the Ruby Rogues podcast, and speaking at conferences.  When James isn't programming, he's usually chasing his two year old daughter around the house.  It's questionable as to which of these pursuits is more taxing.

                       <p>Actions are driven by ideas, and ideas are driven by philosophy. For a
                       deep understanding of our actions, we have to go the whole way back to
                       the philosophy that motivates them. So what's the philosophical basis
                       for Object Oriented Programming? In this talk, [the speaker] will discuss
                       Plato's theory of forms, its relationship to Object Oriented
                       Programming, and its current relevance (or irrelevance) to modern
                       philosophy.</p>

                       <h4>Functional Principles for OO Development</h4>
                      <p>So you consider yourself an Object Oriented developer? Ruby isn't limited to an OO style! See what functional programming can do for us, without learning any new language. These six principles of functional style apply in OO code.  Some of these principles you already use; some express patterns old and new; all give us different ways of thinking about problems. Developers without expertise in functional programming will find new techniques for thinking and coding in Ruby.

                       Or are they?
                       In this demonstration I'll be walking through how I use ruby to teach computers to surprise me with answers to problems I don't know how to solve.
                       It draws heavily on testing to model behavior, stats, and rubies power to create domain specific languages; so hang on to your hats!

                       <p>
                         Out of the box, Rails does its best to help you secure your app. Unfortunately, without consistent application of secure development principles, practices and tools, it's just a matter of time before vulnerabilities creep in.
                         The best time to start locking down your app now, not after your first close call (or worse). We'll walk through exactly what you need to reduce the risk of a security breach to your business, beyond the Rails defaults.

                         Metaprogramming. It's awesome, right? Powerful? Maybe a little scary?
Let's kick things up a notch. If writing code that writes code is powerful, what's hacking the life of the programmer writing the code? That's got to be an 11 on the meta-meter. At least. We'll talk about some of the bad assumptions we've made, lies we've bought into, and why we have the most awesome job ever.

                       <h4>DCI: semiotics applied to software</h4>
                       <p>Formally, semiotics is the study of signs: how do they relate?, how do they structure meaning?, what rules do they follow?
                       All these questions are important to understand how humans communicate and how we interpret the world around us, so it's no wonder that semiotics are related to the process of building software.
                       We, as developers, create software that communicates not only to the end user, but also to other systems and even to other developers. A clear separation of each part of the ""final message"" is important to keep the code maintainable and more important, to control the meaning of our app.
                       DCI is an elegant way to keep that separation clear, we can manage the "rules" (context), the "symbols" (data) and the "meaning" (information) of the message.
                       During this talk I'll explore some concepts of semiotics which are important for DCI and how DCI uses those concepts to communicate.
                       Part of the talk includes an overview of an app I'm building using grape, which allowed me to build from scratch an architecture based on DCI an experiment ideas and concepts I'd like to share with you.

                    <p>Across my twelve years as software developer I've worked with several projects including high tech industries, educational organizations, financial entities. I've programmed with java, objective-c, php, js and my favorite one, ruby. However no matter what language I'm using I always follow two principles:
                      <ol>
                        <li>the code I write now will be read later, so it must be comprehensible.</li>
                        <li>the final product must be usable.</li>
                      </ol>
                    <p>Among my hobbies, two of them have influenced the way I program: photography and martial arts taught me to search the balance between beauty and efficiency of the code.</p>

                       <p>Long the provence of specialists in the hermetic world of enterprise software development, business intelligence (BI) is increasingly important to smaller, more agile companies and startups who need access to near-real-time information to make critical business decisions. With its support for aggregation and reduction of massive amounts of data and its flexible schemas, MongoDB is a great choice for creating lightweight, denormalized data stores optimized for BI, with the added bonus of peaceful co-existence with transactional data stores. In this talk I will explore how Trunk Club captures and analyzes customer information, monitors user behaviour, feeds machine-learning algorithms for decision support, and delivers value to business stakeholders through simple querying and reporting interfaces.</p>

                       how to work time-boxed, get rid of distractions, focus on a single task for 25 minutes, and relax for 
                       couple of minutes to free your mind. We all love Open Source work and Pomodoro will help you to hack
                       on your beloved babies in a time-boxed way to get more done in less time.

                         Remember when you first get started on an existing project, and you have to get your development environment setup?
                         <ul>
                           <li>"You need Postgres and Ruby", so you get that installed.</li>
                           <li>"Oh wait, we can't run 1.9.3, you need 1.9.2", so you change Ruby.</li>
                           <li>"bundle is failing?  Oh yeah, that gems needs some native packages, better google it".</li>
                          <li>"Why isn't that feature working? Oh yeah, I just remembered you need to install wkhtmltopdf for that to work"; it's still not working, "oh, you didn't install that with the package manager did you, that one never works, you have to download a binary and install it manually."</li>

                         In an environment with more than one project it's even worse, since you could be moving between different projects each with their own unique requirements.
                         <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/why.html" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> allows you to configure what you need installed on your development machine and isolate it into a headless VM to use for development.  In our consulting shop, a new developer can usually be up and running in about 15 minutes with a complete development environment and ready to start coding.  And if you really manage to mess something up badly, you can just destroy the whole thing and rebuild it with a couple commands.

                       <h4>Nobody will Train You but You</h4>
                       <p>Why do we all know a developer who has been pounding out unmaintainable code for a decade or more? Why do people ""believe in TDD but I don't have time to write tests during crunch?""  How is it that we have an entire industry based around rescuing teams from acutely awful Rails apps? 
                       It's because on the job experience is a poor teacher, plateauing as soon as the developer is able to ship code that meets requirements. Schools teach Computer Science which is only tangentially related to being a developer and most kata's are approached incorrectly, giving no value at best, and reinforcing poor practices at worst. On top of all this, our pairs (for the lucky ones who pair program) probably have not shown us anything new in months.
                       This presentation will give specific, concrete steps on how to slowly and steadily improve our game through practice and hard work. I'll identify what skill Rails developers should be focusing on and walk the audience through how to target and eliminate these weaknesses so that nothing but white hot joy streams out of our fingers and into our apps. There's no magic here, no secrets, and no hacks; just you and me working our butts off until we suck a little less.

                       <p>Amazon’s toolbox of services can be pretty intimidating at first, and there are many possible solutions for scalability and redundancy.  We’ve combined those tools with the power of Ruby to build a decoupled highly-testable platform that is a developers dream.  We’re going to share what we learned on this journey.

                    <p>I’ve been developing software for most of my life.  I’ve coded in many languages but finally was introduced to Ruby at a conference in Denver and have never looked back.  Since then,  I’ve been an attendee of many conferences but hadn’t had the urge to speak until now. I am continually looking to become a better developer while pushing the envelopes of the technology people consider the norm.  Having recently written a large application in Ruby with a Service Oriented Architecture I believe I have a lot of powerful information to share that will motivate others to think outside the box.</p>

                       <h4>Frustration Driven Development</h4>
                       <p>
                         Everyone draws inspiration and motivation from different sources.
                         For most, it’s often frustration.
                         We make life decisions, define new features, or refactor code when we get too annoyed by current circumstances. This is where [the speaker] admits they has a low tolerance for frustration. Having been frustrated a great deal during his career, [the speaker] will discuss several anti-patterns that they have seen in code and how to use the Dark Side of the Force (frustration, anger, and rage) to escape from them.
                       </p>
                     </div>
                    <p>I've been a developer for 17 years the past six of which have been primarily in Ruby. While I came for the Rails but I stayed for the Ruby.  The more that I learn, the less I feel that I know. But I love to share what I have learned, give back to the community, and benefit others and it puts my knowledge through the crucible of peer review.
                     I also run the annual Ruby DCamp "conference" in Northern Virginia (going into our sixth year) and provide freelance development services (and I'm always looking for more work).</p>

                         Do you actually know how deliberately acquire, sharpen, and retain a technical skill? In this talk, I'll discuss common strategies to enable you to be more focused, creative, and productive while learning, by using play, exploration, and ultimately failure. You'll leave knowing several "Experiential Learning" patterns and techniques that can help you turn failure into success.
                         When was the last time you failed in a spectacular fashion? Was it really so bad?  If you want to succeed, you first need to take a little time to fail.

                       <h4>Ruby Groups: Act Locally - Think Globally</h4>
                       <p>
                        There are thousands of local Ruby groups worldwide. Sadly, many suffer along, become stagnant, some even die off. How can you make your local Ruby Group better and in so doing, improve the global Ruby Community?
                       This talk focuses on the human side of getting a group together and making it successful so the members, as a group can contribute to the larger community. It is a universally useful guide to improving all parts of the ruby community, starting on a local level.

Traveling to conferences and Ruby meet ups around the US and Canada, I like to spread the word on the importance of community and coding, stressing the importance of outreach and focusing on the human side of being a coder.
