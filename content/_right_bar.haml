          %p
            Yehuda Katz is currently employed by
            %a{ :href => "http://www.engineyard.com/" }
              Engine Yard
            , and works full time as a Core Team Member on the Rails project. He is the co-author of
            %a{ :href => "http://www.manning.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=485_93" }
              jQuery in Action
            and the upcoming
            %a{ :href => "http://www.manning.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=485_145" }
              Rails 3 in Action
            , and is a contributor to
            %a{ :href => "http://www.manning.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=485_96" }
              Ruby in Practice
            \.
                
            He spends most of his time hacking on Rails, but also on other Ruby community projects, like
            %a{ :href => "http://rubini.us/" }
              Rubinius
            and
            %a{ :href => "http://datamapper.org/" }
              Datamapper
            \. And when the solution doesn't yet exist, he'll try his hand at creating one - as such, he's also created projects like
            %a{ :href => "http://github.com/wycats/thor/" }
              Thor
            and
            %a{ :href => "http://github.com/sam/do" }
              DO.rb
            \.
